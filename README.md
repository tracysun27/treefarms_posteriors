Spring 2025 Independent Study (maptree part)

This was some code I wrote for independent study in Spring 2025. Building upon my previous work for my CS 671D final project. The code in this repository uses MAPTree, a method from the paper '_MAPTree: Beating "Optimal" Decision Trees with Bayesian Decision Trees_' by Colin Sullivan*, Mo Tiwari*, and Sebastian Thrun, to find trees that maximize the posterior. I then look at their objectives according to treefarms and compare their posteriors with that of the trees in the Rashomon set found by treefarms for some different levels of hyperparameters.

The code for MAPTree that I used: https://github.com/ThrunGroup/maptree/tree/main

The treefarms part of the code I wrote: https://github.com/tracysun27/treefarms_posteriors_pt1
